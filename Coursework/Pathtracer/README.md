# Pathtracer Submission Readme

This folder is where you should place your completed path-traced scene (i.e. Blender scene file in .blend format), when submitting your coursework.

Your Blender scene should be set up and ready to render your scene, in the Cycles rendering engine (do not use Eevee). Pressing F12 or the Render->Render Image options should render your path-traced scene in 1920x1080 FHD resolution.

Remember that **all materials and lighting must be created by you** and **any resources used (e.g. meshes, textures) must be credited in your REFERENCES.md file**.
