# Rendered Image Submission README

This folder is where you should place your reference image, and all your complete rendered images. There should be 4 images here in total.

1. Your reference image
2. Your rasterised image (output of your rasteriser code)
3. Your ray-traced image (output of your ray-tracer code)
4. Your path-traced image (output from Blender, rendering using Cycles)

All images must be FHD resolution (1920x1080), in a common image format (likely PNG, but WEBP, JPEG also acceptable).

Filenames should make it clear which image is which, e.g.

1. reference.png
2. rasterised.png
3. raytraced.png
4. pathtraced.png

All must be produced by the current version of your code and Blender scene, in the GitHub release submitted for the coursework.
