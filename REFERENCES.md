Use this file to credit any 3rd party resources used to implement your coursework, such as meshes and textures, providing URLs (web links) for each.

As an example, below I have referenced assets used in the Labs.

## Labs and Coursework Starter Code

* Bunny, Armadillo and Chinese Dragon from the [Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/) (models have been tidied and decimated).
* Textured Stanford Bunny (model and UVs) by [001comic@sketchfab.com](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/stanford-bunny-883eec40ad724aeab2f3ca101420db33) (some modifications made to texture to avoid seams).
* Spot the Cow test model by [Keenan Crane](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/ModelRepository/#spot)
